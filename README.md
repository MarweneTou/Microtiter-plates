# Microtiter-plates
This code was written in order to classify 101 bacteria isolated from nutrient depleted environments 
Based on their capabilities to grow under different types of media ranging from rich to poor nutrient content, we could draw a pca graph that group them in different clusters.
We could assign the bacteria clusters to facultative and obligate oligotrophic bacteria based on their growth responses.
